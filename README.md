This is my very first project using React. This quiz game has the following features:

1. Created with create-react-app
2. Uses axios to fetch quiz questions (https://opentdb.com/) and contestant names (https://randomuser.me)
3. Uses localStorage to persist the game state
4. Includes functional, class based, and pure components
5. Uses Bootstrap 4
6. Utilizes new features in ES6

STILL TO DO
* Make responsive
